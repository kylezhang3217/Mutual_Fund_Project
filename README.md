# Mutual_Fund_Project

This project is intended for me to understand which mutual funds have "good performance", and why.
"Good performance" will be defined as the ability to come close to or beat a comparable index fund after taxes on distributions of sales and shares. 

To analyze the data, I wrote transformation functions in R that gathers the data, cleans it, and transforms it into the desired form. 

As an example, the screenshot below shows the result when I apply a transformation function to the data for 2018 quarter 4.
