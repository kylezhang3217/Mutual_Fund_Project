# Mutual_Fund_Project

In this personal project, the goal was to learn about mutual funds by delving and analyzing data from a relatively unbiased source, the SEC.

More specifically, I wanted to learn, through data, which mutual funds generate the highest net returns. 

I verified that it is extremely difficult for a mutual fund to consistently beat their index benchmarks. Even if some funds could beat their index benchmark's returns, the difference was often miniscule. 

In this project, I wrote data transformation pipelines that looked through the SEC Data Mutual Fund database, and returned tables of those mutual funds that beat their index benchmark. 

In addition, I had written a transformation script that pulls out the portfolio turnover rate of the mutual funds. 

In Fund_Info_Results, it is an example of what my scripts return when applied to SEC mutual fund data from 2018 quarter 4.
